**This repository contains the code and data files needed to reproduce the analysis for “Targeted cultivation and isolation of probiotic candidate taxa from the cecal microbiota of broiler chickens using culturomics”.**

**Code**

R script containing all code used to process the data tables below and generate figures included in the manuscript.

**Data files (in folder Data tables for R script)**

These processed data files are used as input for the R scripts to generate all figures and analyses presented in the manuscript.

1. Phylum_abundance_in_CD&CI.csv

Contains the relative abundance of bacterial phyla identified using culture-dependent (CD) and culture-independent (CI) approaches.

2. Genus_abundance_in_CD&CI.csv
   
Summarizes the relative abundance of bacterial genera identified by the CD and CI methods.

3. Species_abundance_in_CD&CI.csv
   
Includes the relative abundance of bacterial species detected by CD and CI approaches.

4. Genus_abundance_under_28_conditions.csv
   
Shows the relative abundance of bacterial genera across 14 different media, each cultured under both aerobic (AE) and anaerobic (AN) conditions.

5. CD_abundance_table.csv and Metadata_CD.csv
    
Provide the abundance data and associated metadata for the 161 colony mixtures obtained through the culture-dependent method.

6. 20_beneficial_species_for_sankey.csv
   
Lists the top 20 potentially probiotic bacterial species (ranked by relative abundance) used to generate Sankey diagrams illustrating their distribution across 10 culture conditions.

7. 251_single_colony_abundance_table.csv
   
Contains taxonomic classifications of the 251 single colonies isolated from five selected media and sequenced for 16S rRNA genes.

8. 150_single_species_abundance_table.csv
   
Provides the abundance information of 150 colonies identified as single species with relative abundance exceeding a 95% cutoff.
